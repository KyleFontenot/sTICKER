# Overview
sTICKER serves correlation data on comparison stock options. 

 
## Under The Hood
Created with SolidJS in a single-page-application architecture, it serves dynamic data from a serverless AWS backend. Client-side, stocks are asynchronously loaded into localStorage to display a variety of data points through the comparison page. Back-end is interacted with AWS's API Gateway, which initiates Lambda Functions that pull from DynamoDB. 

## Created with <a href="https://www.propelprojects.org/" target="__blank" rel="noopener">Propel Projects</a>
Thanks to the work of Propel Projects, this project was organized and executed in a team of four, each member belonging to a responsibility. Ux design by Emma Xie, front-end development by Kyle Fontenot, back-end engineering by Pierre-Boisvert, and project management by Eric Oulster.
